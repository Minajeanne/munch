# MUNCH

MUNCH is an application designed to store and share user reviews of restaurants. Users can create their own reviews and restaurants, and they can view other users' reviews and restaurants. By keeping track of where you dine and what your dining experience was like, you can avoid the repeated trauma of a bad meal or simply save time Googling that place you loved downtown that had those drinks with that stuff in it...and get down to eating!
